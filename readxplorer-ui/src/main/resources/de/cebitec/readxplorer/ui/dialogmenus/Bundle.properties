Select the mapping classes to include in the analysis (See Help -> Classification for details).\nFurther decide if only uniquely mapped reads should be included, or all mapped reads.\nNote that "Perfect", "Best" and "Common" mapped reads are never unique, thus cannot be selected together with "unique".

SelectReadClassVisualPanel.decriptionStrandTextArea.textGeneral=2. Select if mappings from the currently analyzed strand, from the opposite strand or combined from both strands are used in the analysis.
SelectReadClassVisualPanel.decriptionStrandTextArea.toolTipText=<html>The selection depends on the <strong>sequencing library</strong> type and the type of the <strong>analysis</strong>. <br>\n1. If the underlying sequencing library of a track is strand specific and <br>\nthe reads map to the strain from which they originated biologically use "<i>Feature Strand</i>".<br> \n2. If the library is strand specific, but the reads map to the opposite strain of their biological origin use "<i>Opposite strand</i>". <br>\n3. If the library is not strand specific use "<i>Combine both strands</i>".<br>\nIn some analyses also other scenarios are imaginable, in which a non default strand selection might be useful.</html>
