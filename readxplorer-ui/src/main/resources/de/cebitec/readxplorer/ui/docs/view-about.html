        <p style="text-align: justify;">ReadXplorer is a client software. The project data for each ReadXplorer
            project is stored in a H2 database (<a href="http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html">h2</a>. The database (DB) contains the reference
            genome and the basic track (= mapping data set) information. Therefore, the reference sequence and
            annotations are stored in the DB for the reference. For the tracks only the basic information,
            such as name and path to the corresponding <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf">BAM</a> file,
            is stored in the DB.</p>

        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Position navigator</span>:
            By clicking "Jump to Pos", the entered position is centered for the currently viewed reference.
            If the reference contains multiple chromosomes/contigs/other sequences, a selection box is displayed as well.
            The position is then chosen from the selected chromosome.justify;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pattern filter</span>: Searches and
            centers the next occurrence of the entered pattern/sequence and highlights all occurrences in the currently
            visible interval on the sequence bar of the Reference Viewer in blue. By clicking the "Search Pattern" button
            a second time, the next occurrence of the pattern, which is currently beyond the viewed reference interval,
            is centered.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">d) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference feature filter</span>:
            Filters the currently selected column of the reference feature table below for the regular expression or plain
            text entered in the "RegEx Filter" field. By clicking any of the features in the table, its start position is
            centered in the viewers.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">e) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference Viewer and its
                legend</span>: It displays the reference features in a six frame view, with a sequence bar in the middle.
            The legend displays the coloring of each available feature type and contains a checkbox to enable or disable
            viewing of the respective feature type. In the example all features are shown, except the features of the
            type "unknown". Next to the legend, a chromosome selection box is shown, if multiple chromosomes/contigs/other sequences
            are contained in the current reference.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">f) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scrollbar and zoom slider</span>:
            They are included in each viewer. The scrollbar allows to scroll to each reference position and the zoom slider
            allows to adjust the zoom level of the currently viewed reference interval.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">g) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selected reference feature</span>: A
            feature selected by a left click is highlighted in blue and its details are shown in the ReferenceFeature Window
            (<em>i)</em>). If start and stop codons are currently shown, then only the codons in the reading frame of the
            selected feature are shown. Only one feature can be selected at a time.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">h) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sequence bar and interactive start
                codons</span>: In the middle of the reference viewer, the sequence bar is shown. When zoomed in completely,
            the reference sequence of both strands is visible. The sequence bar also offers to select a sequence of
            interest by holding the left mouse button on the sequence bar and selecting the sequence of interest. After
            selecting a sequence, the right-click menu offers the options shown in the screenshot below. E.g.
            copying or storing (as fasta) the sequence of interest and predicting the RNA secondary structure (see
            <i><a href="nbdocs://de.cebitec.readxplorer.tools.rnaFolder/de/cebitec/readxplorer/tools/rnaFolder/docs/rnaFolder-about.html">RNA Secondary Structure Prediction</a></i>). Furthermore, the sequence bar displays start and stop
            codons, if they are selected in (<em>o)</em>). By clicking on a highlighted start codon (red) the reference
            interval from the start to the next in-frame stop codon is highlighted in light blue. By clicking the start
            codon again, the highlighting disappears. For more details see <i><a href="nbdocs://de.cebitec.readxplorer.options/de/cebitec/readxplorer/options/docs/options-about.html">Options - Genetic Code</a></i>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="nbdocs://de.cebitec.readxplorer.ui/de/cebitec/readxplorer/ui/docs/seq-selection.jpg" alt="seqSelection" />
            <br /></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">i) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference Feature Window</span>:
            Displays the details of the currently selected reference feature. Here, the list of "
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parents</span>" is the list of reference features placed directly
            upward in the feature hierarchy and the list of "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subfeatures</span>"
            contains all features placed directly downward in the feature hierarchy. The hierarchy is based on the
            attribution in the original reference file (e.g. GFF3 feature hierarchy). When other import formats are used
            (Genbank, EMBL), a gene is the top parent feature and can contain exons, CDS and different RNAs. An exon can
            again contain CDS or RNA annotations.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">j) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Track Viewer and its Legend</span>:
            Displays the coloring of the five mapping classes used by ReadXplorer. The green area ((Single) Perfect) depicts
            reads that perfectly map to the reference sequence with either exactly one (Single Perfect Match, green) or multiple
            perfect mappings (Perfect Match, light green), the yellow area ((Single) Best Match) depicts reads that map to the
            respective location of the reference with the least possible number of mismatches in the whole reference. If exactly
            one Best Match mapping exists for the read, it is a Single Best Match (dark yellow), but there can be more than one
            mapping for one read on the reference with e.g. 2 mismatches. In this case both belong to the Best Match class (bright yellow).
            A red area (Common Match) depicts reads that still match to the red colored region of the reference with less than the
            maximum allowed mismatches during the mapping process, but there is another position in the reference, where they fit
            with less mismatches. For further details see
            <i><a href="nbdocs://de.cebitec.readxplorer.ui/de/cebitec/readxplorer/ui/docs/classification-about.html">Read Classification</a></i>.
            The options menu of the Track Viewer is described in <em>m)</em>.<br /></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">k) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Track Viewer tooltip</span>: The
            tooltip shows the coverage of the hovered reference position for all five supported mapping classes separated
            by strand.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">l) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Track Statistics Window</span>:
            Displays the global data set statistics of the currently selected track. </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Mappings: The total number of mappings in the whole data set, which were
                mapped to this reference.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Unique mappings: The total number of mappings among the number of "Mappings",
                which where only mapped once to the reference.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Single Perfect mappings: The total number of mappings belonging to the Single
                Perfect Match class in the whole track data set.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Perfect mappings: The total number of mappings belonging to the Perfect Match
                class in the whole track data set.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Single Best Match mappings: The total number of mappings belonging to the Single
                Best Match class in the whole track data set.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Best Match mappings: The total number of mappings belonging to the best match class
                in the whole track data set.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Single Perfect Match coverage: The percentage of the reference sequence, covered by
                at least one mapping of the Single Perfect Match mapping class.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Perfect Match coverage: The percentage of the reference sequence, covered by at
                least one mapping of the Perfect Match mapping class.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Single Best Match coverage: The percentage of the reference sequence, covered by
                at least one mapping of the Single Best Match mapping class.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Best Match coverage: The percentage of the reference sequence, covered by at least
                one mapping of the Best Match mapping class.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Common Match coverage: The percentage of the reference sequence, covered by at least one mapping
                of the Common Match mapping class.<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">If the currently viewed track is a read pair (paired-end or mate pair) data set,
            the read pair statistic is displayed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Read Pairs: The total number of read pairs successfully (= at
                least one read of the pair) mapped to the reference sequence in the whole track data set.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Perfect read pairs: The number of perfect read pairs, whose distance is
                within a given range and whose orientation is as expected.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Smaller read pairs: The number of read pairs whose distance is smaller than
                the minimum allowed distance of a perfect pair.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Larger read pairs: The number of read pairs whose distance is larger than
                the maximum allowed distance of a perfect pair.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Single mappings: The number of mappings whose partner either did not map to
                the reference at all, or is already contained in a perfect or smaller distance pair with the read of this
                mapping and its partner. The latter can occur, when e.g. one read of a read pair maps to two or more
                positions in the reference, but in one position it can form a perfect or smaller distance pair with its
                partner. Then all other mappings of the multi mapped read are classified as single mappings.
                <br data-mce-bogus="1" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">m) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Track
                Viewer Options</span>: Here, the coverage can be filtered by mapping quality (if the quality is available
            for this data set, otherwise nothing is changed). Automatic scaling of the coverage can be enabled to adapt the coverage
            plot to fit the viewer area. Besides that, a normalization method can be applied to the coverage of the
            track: either by log2 or by a chosen factor x with 0 &lt; x &lt; 10.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">n) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference Interval Window</span>:
            It summarizes information about the currently viewed reference interval.
        <p style="text-align: justify;">o) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Start and stop codon
                selection</span>: Allows the selection of start and stop codons, which are then highlighted in the
            sequence bar of the reference viewer (h). If you want to change the start and stop codons to fit another
            organism (see <i><a href="nbdocs://de.cebitec.readxplorer.options/de/cebitec/readxplorer/options/docs/options-about.html">Options - Genetic Code</a></i>).</p>
