        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>General Analysis Framework: <br /></strong></span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">All integrated analysis methods rely on the mapping classification (see <i><a href="nbdocs://de.cebitec.readxplorer.ui/de/cebitec/readxplorer/ui/docs/classification-about.html">Read Classification</a></i>). 
            All parameters are user adjustable and configured via simple wizards. For references with multiple chromosomes/contigs/other sequences, 
            the complete reference genome is analyzed. <br /> Analyses supported by ReadXplorer 
            are single nucleotide and insertion-deletion polymorphism <b>(SNP and DIP</b>) 
            <b>detection</b>, a reference <b>feature coverage analysis, </b>a general <strong>coverage analysis</strong>, and 
            <b>RNA secondary structure prediction</b>. 
            Especially for <b>RNA-seq</b> experiments it offers 
            <b>differential gene expression</b>, 
            <b>transcription start site</b> (TSS), 
            <b>novel transcript</b> and <b>operon detection</b> as well as <b>read count</b> and <b>read count normalization</b> calculations (<b>RPKM</b> and <b>TPM</b>) per reference feature. All analyses can operate on <strong>combined data sets</strong>. Just select "
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combine selected tracks</span>" in the 
            track selection for the analysis.<br /> The results of all these analyses are displayed 
            in form of <b>tables</b> which can be <b>sorted</b> by each column, <b>filtered</b> by column values. Additionally, the 
            reference position of the currently selected result is <b>centered</b> in each corresponding data viewer. 
            Below the result table the used <strong>parameters</strong> of the current analysis are shown and a small 
            <strong>statistic</strong> can be viewed by clicking "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show Statistics</span>".
            <br /> All analysis result tables can directly be <b>exported</b> into <b>Excel (xls)</b> or <b>CSV</b> files. These include an extra 
            sheet/file with the search parameters, the ReadXplorer version and a small statistic for the performed analysis. When the 
            results are too long for one xls sheet, another xls sheet is added to the file, until all 
            data is stored in the file.<br /> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE: For cells with multi-line entries in Excel:<br /> </span>If the line break is not used by default, you have to turn it on:<br /> Mark all data -&gt; right click data -&gt; Format cells -&gt; Alignment -&gt; Check line break -&gt; Click OK </p>
