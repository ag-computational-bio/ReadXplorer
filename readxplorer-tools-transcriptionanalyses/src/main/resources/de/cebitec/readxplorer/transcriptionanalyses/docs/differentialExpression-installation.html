        <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since Version 2.1 the connection from ReadXplorer to GNU R is realized using RServe instead of rJava.</span><br/>

        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Windows Setup:</strong></span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            We offer a pre-build GNU R package for Windows that contains all necessary R packages.
            <br/>
            Within ReadXplorer go to "Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R" and select "Download and Install GNU R".
            <br/>
            After accepting the License the download will start automatically and a progress indicator will appear. When the installation is finished you can use the differential expression analysis located in the "Tool" menu.

        <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>OS X Setup:</strong></span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            We do not offer a OS X version with a bundled GNU R installation anymore. However, the GNU R configuration page located within ReadXplorer ("ReadXplorer" &rarr; "Preferences" &rarr; "GNU R") offers the option to configure a connection to a user installed GNU R installation. It is possible to run the R instance on your local machine as well as connecting to a GNU R instance running on a remote host. Due to security constrains in OS X the usage of a startup-script is not possible. You must start your GNU R Rserve instance manually. The Setup procedure is the same as described in the section "Installing a GNU R instance" in the "Linux Setup" chapter.

        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Linux Setup:</strong></span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            As there are so many different versions of Linux we do not offer an automatic installation on Linux systems. However, the GNU R configuration page located within ReadXplorer ("Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R") offers advanced setup options that allow different setup scenarios on Linux system. It is possible to run the R instance on your local machine as well as connecting to a GNU R instance running on a remote host. A few setup examples are given below.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Installing a GNU R instance:</span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            For each scenario the machine that should run GNU R needs the required Software at first. Obviously, the first thing that needs to be installed is GNU R itself. The GNU R versions we use for Mac OS and Windows is 3.2.0, other 3.X versions should work as well, but we did not test them. There are GNU R packages included in most Linux distribution you can use or you can download the source-code at https://www.r-project.org/ . Which way is the best to go depends on your personal preferences and the Linux distribution you are using.
            <br/>
            After installing GNU R you also need to download the required, additional R packages used by ReadXplorer. For the connection between ReadXplorer and GNU R we need "RServe", which can be installed in an open R session by typing:</p><br/>
        <pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><code>
            install.packages("Rserve")
        </code></span></pre>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            We also need the packages for "baySeq", "DESeq" and "DESeq2". These packages are hosted on http://bioconductor.org/ . The installation is done in R by typing: </p><br/>
            <pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><code>
            ## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
            source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
            biocLite("baySeq")
        </code></span></pre>
        <pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><code>
            source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
            biocLite("DESeq")
        </code></span></pre>
        <pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><code>
            source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
            biocLite("DESeq2")
        </code></span></pre>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            If that fails, please find further installation instructions on the http://bioconductor.org/ homepage.<br/>
            Once everything is installed we are ready to setup the connection in one of the ways described below.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Connect to a manually started GNU R instance (local or remote)</span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            Once GNU R and all the necessary packages are installed you can start the RServe instance in different ways. When within a running GNU R session type </p><br/>
        <pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><code>
            library(Rserve)
            Rserve()
        </code></span></pre>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            to start the RServe Server instance. You can also start the RServe server directly from the commandline by executing "R CMD Rserve" provided that R is correctly included in your PATH. After executing one of these commands you will have a running RServe instance listening on its default port 6311 for connections. Please be aware that if you are on a multi user system every one with access to the machine can now connect to this RServe instance which is running with your user privileges. Because GNU R is capable of accessing the local file system this also means that this person can gain access to you files. So if you are on a multiuser system please check the RServe manual on how to setup a password protected connection. The manual also describes how to setup RServe to allow remote connections. This is especially useful if you want to provide one central R instance in your network which can than be used by different users at the same time.
        <br/>
            In a final step the ReadXplorer settings need to be adjusted to connect to the local (or remote) running RServe instance. Within Readxplorer go to "Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R" and select "Manual". Your must now enter the IP Address or Hostname of the machine running RServe as well as the port. If the Rserve instance requires authentication check the "Use authentication" checkbox and enter a valid "Username" and "Password" combination. ReadXplorer will store the credentials in the key storage provided by you operating system. If your RServe instance is running on your local machine (the same machine you are running ReadXplorer on) and you haven't changed the default port you can just use the default settings ("localhost" as "RServe Host" and "6311" as "RServe Port"). You should now be able to run the differential gene expression analysis located in the "Tools" menu.
            <br/>

        </p>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Use a startup script (local)</span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            ReadXplorer also offers you the usage of a startup script. This allows ReadXplorer to start up the R instance when needed and to shut it down after the computation is complete. A startup script could for example look like this:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><code>
            #!/bin/bash
            R CMD Rserve --RS-port $1 --vanilla
        </code></span></pre>
        <br/>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            ReadXplorer will execute the startup script each time a differential gene expression analysis is started unless there is already a running instance. In this case the already running instance will be used. On Linux hosts multiple connections to one RServe instance should cause no problems. The path to the startup script can be set in the options menu at "Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R". The specified port will be handed over to the startup script as the first argument.
        </p>
